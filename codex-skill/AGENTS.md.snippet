## Superego Metacognitive Oversight

This project uses superego for metacognitive oversight. You have the `$superego` skill available.

**When to use $superego:**
- Before making large changes (10+ lines across multiple files)
- Before refactoring or architectural decisions
- When uncertain about the approach
- Before claiming work is "done"

**How to use:**
1. Invoke `$superego` to run evaluation
2. Review the feedback
3. If concerns are found, discuss with the user before proceeding
4. If no concerns, continue with confidence

**Do not skip superego evaluation** for non-trivial changes. The user expects metacognitive oversight on this project.
