## Superego Metacognitive Oversight

This project uses superego for metacognitive oversight. You have the `$superego` skill available.

**When to use $superego:**
- **Before committing to a plan or approach** - when you've decided HOW to solve something
- **When choosing between alternatives** - before picking option A vs B vs C
- **Before non-trivial implementations** - anything that touches multiple files or introduces new patterns
- **When the task feels complex or uncertain** - trust your instincts
- **Before claiming work is "done"** - final sanity check

The key insight: superego catches strategic mistakes (wrong approach, over-engineering, scope creep), not syntax errors. Use it at **decision points**, not just before large edits.

**How to use:**
1. Invoke `$superego` to run evaluation
2. If `has_concerns: true` - STOP and show feedback to user, ask before proceeding
3. If `has_concerns: false` - continue with confidence
4. If `skipped: true` - proceed normally (this is fine, not an error)

**Do not skip superego evaluation** for planning or non-trivial work. The user expects metacognitive oversight on this project.
